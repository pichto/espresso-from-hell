# Espresso - The Band

Bass and Voice encounter, spiced up with some loopers
flavour, Espresso From Hell plays jazz and pop songs in it's own original way.

Everything started some years ago when Brigitte and Pierre,
long time friends, decided to play in duo "just for fun". It went so
well that despite the lack of free time it leaded to an album in 2015\.  
What else ?

EFH is :

* Brigitte Savoy - voice and loopers
* Pierre Sottas - bass and loopers
